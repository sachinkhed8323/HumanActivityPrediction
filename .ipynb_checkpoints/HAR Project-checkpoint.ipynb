    "- This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.\n",

    "- This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually."

    "1. These sensor signals are preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width windows(sliding windows) of 2.56 seconds each with 50% overlap. ie., each window has 128 readings. \n",
    "2. From Each window, a feature vector was obtianed by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.\n",
    "In our dataset, each datapoint represents a window with different readings\n",
    "3. The accelertion signal was saperated into Body and Gravity acceleration signals(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using some low pass filter with corner frequecy of 0.3Hz. \n",
    "4. After that, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtian jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). \n",
    "5. The magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidian norm. This magnitudes are represented as features with names like tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag and tBodyGyroJerkMag. \n",
    "6. Finally, We've got frequency domain signals from some of the available signals by applying a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). These signals obtained were labeled with prefix 'f' just like original signals with prefix 't'. These signals are labeled as fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyGyroMag etc.,. \n",
